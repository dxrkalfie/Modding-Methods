4. Next You Want To Find Your **data.unity3d** And Open It in **uabea** And make sure to click **Memory** When it asks "File" "Memory" or "Close"
5. Once Open, Make sure you are on **Level0** (However the game might have different levels so if it isnt level0 check a different one!)
6. Once you are on it press **info** to open up the **Assets Info Panel**
7. Once that is open / on your screen, find an object that you want to be enabled / disabled (Best way is pressing on a random object and press "View Scene")
# If you didn't do the Scene part (you can still do this if you have)
8. once you have found your object (either staff items, anti cheat object, What ever) on the **Assets info** panel click **Edit Data**
9. once that has been pressed, its either going to say bool m_IsActive = true or bool m_IsActive = false so if its false and you want it to be enabled you want it to be true

# If you did the Scene way (same way just different)
10. press on the object you want
11. On the components side you should see something that says "Transform base" if its closed open it!
12. clock on the first one where it says "m_GameObject" then you should see something called **view Asset**
13. Right Click it, then press **Edit Asset**
14. Then change bool m_IsActive = true or bool m_IsActive = false to be true if its a staff cosmetic or false if its something you dont want
