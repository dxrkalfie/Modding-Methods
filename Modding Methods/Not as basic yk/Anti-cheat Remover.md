2. Go to the file that says **-** and press on it
3. Search for a script name like "Kick" or "anticheat" or "application.quit" or something like that
4. If you find script like that make sure to copy it down into a notepad (What the script is called!)

# How to delete the script

6. Find the **data.unity3d** file and open it 
7. Once the file is open, Go to any thing.
